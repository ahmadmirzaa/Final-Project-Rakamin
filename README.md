PT DahLah is an e-commerce company where the marketing team has spent a lot of money on customer acquisition, but the level of customer satisfaction is still low which has resulted in decreased company revenue. This is due to the late delivery factor which is still high at 59.67%. Customer satisfaction is one of the keys to retaining customers. It costs much less to retain customers than to find a new one.

We have to solve the late delivery problem by creating a model to predict whether the delivery will be late or not. After modeling, we can reduce the percentage of late delivery and increase customer satisfaction by providing the type of shipment along with the estimated time. So the loss revenue will decrease.
